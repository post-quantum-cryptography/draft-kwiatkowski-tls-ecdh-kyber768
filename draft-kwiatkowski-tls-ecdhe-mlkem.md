--- abstract

This draft defines a hybrid key agreement for TLS 1.3 that combines
a post-quantum KEM with elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE).

# Introduction

## Motivation
ML-KEM is a key encapsulation method (KEM) designed to be resistant to cryptanalytic attacks with quantum computers.

Experimentation and early deployments are crucial part of the migration to post-quantum cryptography. To promote interoperability of those deployments this document provides specification of hybrid post-quantum key agreement to be used in TLS 1.3 protocol.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Negotiated Groups

This document defines an additional supported group which can be used for
hybrid post-quantum key agreements. The hybrid key agreement for TLS 1.3 is
detailed in the {{hybrid}} draft. We compose the hybrid scheme with the ML-KEM
as defined in {{?FIPS-203=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203}}, and the ECDHE scheme parametrized with
elliptic curves defined in ANSI X9.62 [ECDSA] and NIST SP 800-186
{{?DSS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.SP.800-186}}.

The new group allows deriving TLS session keys by using FIPS-approved schemes.
NIST's special publication 800-56Cr2 {{?SP56C=DOI.10.6028/NIST.SP.800-56Cr2}}
approves the usage of HKDF {{HKDF}} with two distinct shared secrets as long as the first
one is computed by a FIPS-approved key-establishment scheme. This draft specifies
a new supported group in which both shared secretes are computed by FIPS-approved mechanisms.
The first one is ECDHE and a curve secp256r1 (NIST P-256) are FIPS-approved by NIST
SP 800-56Ar3 {{?SP56A=DOI.10.6028/NIST.SP.800-56Ar3}} and NIST SP 800-186
{{?DSS=DOI.10.6028/NIST.SP.800-186}} correspondingly. The second one is ML-KEM-768 that
is FIPS-approved by {{?FIPS-203=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203}}.

## Construction

The name of the new supported hybrid post-quantum group is SecP256r1MLKEM768.

When this group is negotiated, the client's share is a fixed-size concatenation of
the ECDHE share and ML-KEM's public key. The ECDHE share is the serialized value of
the uncompressed ECDH point representation as defined in Section 4.2.8.2 of {{!RFC8446}}.
The ML-KEM's ephemeral share is the public key of the key generation step (see
{{?FIPS-203=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203}}, section 7.1) represented as an octet string. The size
of client share is 1249 bytes (65 bytes of ECDHE part and 1184 of ML-KEM part).

The server's share is a fixed-size concatenation of ECDHE share and ML-KEM's ciphertext
returned from encapsulation (see {{?FIPS-203=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203}}, section 7.2).
The server ECDHE share is the serialized value of the uncompressed ECDH point representation
as defined in Section 4.2.8.2 of {{!RFC8446}}. The server share is the ML-KEM's ciphertext
returned from the Encapsulate step (see {{?FIPS-203=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203}}, section 7.2)
represented as an octet string. The size of server's share is 1153 bytes (65 bytes of ECDHE
part and 1088 of ML-KEM part).

Finally, the shared secret is a concatenation of the ECDHE and the ML-KEM
shared secrets. The ECDHE shared secret is the x-coordinate of the ECDH
shared secret elliptic curve point represented as an octet string as
defined in Section 7.4.2 of {{!RFC8446}}. The ML-KEM shared secret is the
value returned from either encapsulation (on the server side) or decapsulation
(on the client side) represented as an octet string. The size of a shared
secret is 64 bytes (32 bytes of ECDHE part and 32 of ML-KEM part).

# Security Considerations

The same security considerations as those described in {{hybrid}} apply to the approach used by this document.
Implementers are encouraged to use implementations resistant to side-channel attacks, especially those that can be applied by remote attackers.

# IANA Considerations

This document requests/registers a new entry to the TLS Supported Groups
 registry, according to the procedures in {{Section 6 of tlsiana}}. These identifiers are to be used with
 the final, ratified by NIST, version of ML-KEM which is specified in {{?FIPS-203=DOI.10.6028/NIST.FIPS.203}}.
